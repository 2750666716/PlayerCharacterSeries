# Unreal Engine C++ Player Character
### Movement 02 - Walk, Run, Strafe !? using Blendspaces

Hey guys,

This is the next video in our Unreal Engine C++ Player Character Movement series talking about creating animation states that move our character from a walk to a run, as well expand our stance switching by adding in a new blendspace for strafing.

You can find more details on the subject here: http://jollymonsterstudio.com/2019/04/25/c-player-character-movement-02-walk-run-strafe/

You can find the associated video tutorial here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEVCKqLpSeE


Hope this helps, Thanks.
